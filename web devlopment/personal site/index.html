    <h1>Ali Basher</h1>
    <p><em>Web Developer & Programmer in <strong>Google</strong></em></p>
    <p>My name is Ali Basher and I live in Baghdad. I am 23 years old. I am a 4rd-year student at the University of
        Technology, Department of Computer Science, Network Management Branch. I love programming a lot, especially in
        the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also love inventions as well as logical thinking. I
        like to think outside the box. I love challenges that move my brain and improve my logical thinking. I have good
        skills in programming languages. At the beginning of my education, I learned C++ and then got into more than one
        field like web development and mobile app development to find myself in whatever field I like, and I found
        myself loving Artificial Intelligence. I think AI is very useful for me mainly because it's fun and I have a lot
        of ideas I want to work on in the future after I finish my university study. In addition, I have a lot of skills
        that I obtained through my study and my self-learning by following some YouTube channels. </p>
